            <p ><span class="span-style"> Cartman</span> has been portrayed as aggressive, 
                prejudiced and emotionally unstable since his 
                character's inception. These traits are 
                significantly augmented in later seasons as his 
                character evolves, and he begins to exhibit 
                psychopathic and extremely manipulative behavior. 
                He is depicted as highly intelligent, able to 
                execute morally appalling plans and business ideas 
                with success. Among the show's main child characters, 
                Cartman is distinguished as "the fat kid", for which 
                he is continuously insulted and ridiculed. Cartman 
                is frequently portrayed as a villain whose actions 
                set in motion the events serving as the main plot 
                of an episode. Other children and classmates 
                are alienated by Cartman's insensitive, racist, 
                homophobic, anti-semitic, misogynistic, 
                lazy, self-righteous, and wildly insecure behavior.
                Cartman often makes anti-semitic insults towards 
                Kyle, constantly teases Kenny for being poor,
                particularly manipulates and mistreats Butters 
                Stotch and displays an extreme disdain for hippies.
                Though he is considered the main antagonist of the 
                series, he has been portrayed as a protagonist or 
                antihero on several occasions.</p>

            <p> <span class="span-style">Stanley "Stan" Marsh </span> is one of the show's four 
                central characters and is voiced by and loosely 
                based on series co-creator Trey Parker. 
                He first appeared in The Spirit of Christmas 
                and is portrayed (in words of the show's official 
                website) as "a normal, average, American, mixed-up 
                kid". Stan is a third- then fourth-grade student who commonly 
                has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional 
                small-town life in his hometown of South Park. He is also 
                commonly portrayed as the main protagonist of the series, 
                as in most episodes he plays this role. He is well known 
                for the phrase "Oh my God! They killed Kenny!" which he says 
                in many episodes whenever Kenny is subjected to painful and 
                often gruesome deaths, and this phrase is very well known 
                throughout popular culture.</p>

            <p><span class="span-style">Kyle Broflovski</span> is one of the show's four central 
                characters and is voiced by and loosely based 
                on series co-creator Matt Stone. Having appeared 
                first in The Spirit of Christmas shorts, he often 
                displays the highest moral standard of all the boys 
                and is usually depicted as the most intelligent.
                 When describing Kyle, Stone states that both he and
                  the character are "reactionary", and susceptible 
                  to irritability and impatience. In some 
                  instances, Kyle is the only child in his class 
                  to not initially indulge in a fad or fall victim 
                  to a ploy. This has resulted in both his eagerness 
                  to fit in, and his resentment and frustration.
                   Kyle is distinctive as one of the few Jewish 
                  children on the show, and because of this, 
                  he often feels like an outsider amongst the core 
                  group of characters. His portrayal in 
                  this role is often dealt with satirically, and 
                  has elicited both praise and criticism from Jewish 
                  viewers. In many episodes, Kyle 
                  contemplates ethics in beliefs, moral dilemmas, 
                  and contentious issues, and will often reflect 
                  on the lessons he has attained with a speech 
                  that often begins with "You know, I learned 
                  something today..."</p>

            <p><span class="span-style">Kenneth "Kenny" McCormick</span> is one of the shows' 
                main characters who debuted in the 1992 short. 
                His oft-muffled and indiscernible speech—the 
                result of his parka hood covering his mouth—is 
                voiced by co-creator Matt Stone.[ He is friends 
                with Stan and Kyle, while maintaining a friendship 
                with Eric Cartman. Kenny is regularly teased 
                for living in poverty, particularly by Cartman.[39]
                 Prior to Season Six, Kenny died in almost every 
                 episode, with only a few exceptions.[note 1] The
                 nature of the deaths was often gruesome and 
                 portrayed in a comically absurd fashion, 
                 and usually followed by Stan and Kyle respectively 
                 yelling "Oh my God! They killed Kenny!" and 
                 "You bastard(s)!". In the episode "Kenny Dies",
                  Kenny dies after developing a terminal muscular 
                  disease, while Parker and Stone claimed that 
                  Kenny would not be returning in subsequent episodes 
                  and insisted they grew tired of having Kenny die in 
                  each episode. For most of season six, his place 
                  is taken by Butters Stotch and Tweek Tweak.
                  Nevertheless, Kenny returned from the year-long absence 
                  in the season six finale "Red Sleigh Down", and has 
                  remained a starring character since, although he only 
                  appears once in 1 episode in Season 20. His character 
                  no longer dies each week, and has only been killed 
                  occasionally in episodes following his return. 
                  Kenny's superhero alter ego, Mysterion, first 
                  appeared in the season 13 episode "The Coon". 
                  It is revealed in the season 14 episode “Coon vs. 
                  Coon and Friends” that Kenny canonically has an 
                  ability to resurrect after dying, though he is 
                  always the only one who can ever remember dying, 
                  despite his friends always bearing witness. It is 
                  revealed that each time he dies, Kenny's mom 
                  spontaneously gives birth to him, and then is 
                  put back in his orange parka and in bed, to 
                  regenerate overnight. This was due to his parents’ 
                  involvement in the cult of Cthulhu, whose meetings
                   they would only attend because of the free alcohol."</p>
